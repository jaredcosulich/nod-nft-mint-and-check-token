This component provides the basic plumbing for interacting with an NFT smart contract.

It allows you to connect with a wallet using web3modal, query a contract to get it's minting price, and mint it.

Once minted the user will gain access to gated content.

There are a number of subcomponents involved. You can find a live demo of this component (as a project) in action here: 

[Hosted SimpleNFTGatedContent](https://jaredcosulich.github.io/SimpleNFTGatedContent) where you can mint an NFT on the rinkeby network.

It currently points to the [SimpleURIAndPriceNFTWithWithdrawalRoyalty](https://nexttemplate-eight.vercel.app/docs/SimpleURIAndPriceNFTWithWithdrawalRoyalty) contract.
